**Managed Mode** is a [`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) configuration option that tells `buf` to set all of the file
options in your module according to an opinionated set of values suitable for each of the supported Protobuf languages (e.g. Go, Java, C#, etc.).
The file options are written *on the fly* so that they never have to be written in the Protobuf source file itself.

## Background

One of the largest drawbacks of Protobuf is the hardcoding of language-specific options within Protobuf definitions themselves.
For example, consider the following `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` file in the given file `tree`:

```sh
.
├── acme
│   └── weather
│       └── v1
│           └── weather.proto
└── buf.yaml
```

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_outer_classname = "WeatherProto";
option java_package = "com.acme.weather.v1";
```

None of these options have anything to do with the API definition within Protobuf - they are all API *consumer* concerns, not API *producer* concerns.
Different consumers may (and usually do) want different values for these options, especially when a given set of Protobuf definitions is consumed in
many different places. This gets especially bad with imports - anyone in Go who has had to specify long chains of `--go_opt=Mpath/to/foo.proto=github.com/pkg/foo`
can attest to the severity of the situation.

**Managed Mode** addresses this problem head-on so that users can remove file options from their Protobuf APIs altogether.

## Configuration

Configuring **Managed Mode** is easy - all you need to do is add the `managed.enabled` option to your `buf.gen.yaml` template. An example `buf.gen.yaml`
template that uses the `protoc-gen-java` plugin is shown below:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
plugins:
  - name: java
    out: gen/proto/java
```

With this, you can remove all of the standard file option declarations from all of our Protobuf files entirely, and leave the rest to `buf`.

> **Managed Mode** only supports the standard file options included in Protobuf by default. It's impossible for `buf` to establish an opinion
> for the custom options you might define, so such options will still need to be checked into your Protobuf source files.

### `managed`

The `managed` key is used to configure **Managed Mode**. A complete example of the `managed` configuration with the `protoc-gen-go` plugin is
shown below:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  cc_enable_arenas: false
  java_multiple_files: false
  java_package_prefix: com
  java_string_check_utf8: false
  optimize_for: CODE_SIZE
  go_package_prefix:
    default: github.com/acme/weather/private/gen/proto/go
    except:
      - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
    override:
      buf.build/acme/weather: github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go
  override:
    JAVA_PACKAGE_PREFIX:
      acme/weather/v1/weather.proto: "org"
plugins:
  - name: go
    out: gen/proto/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

#### `enabled`

The `enabled` key is **required** if *any* other `managed` keys are set. Setting `enabled` equal to `true` will
enable **Managed Mode** according to [default behavior](#default-behavior).

#### `cc_enable_arenas`

The `cc_enable_arenas` key is **optional**, and controls what the [cc_enable_arenas](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L420)
value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target [input](../reference/inputs.md). The only accepted values are `false`
and `true`.

#### `java_multiple_files`

The `java_multiple_files` key is **optional**, and controls what the [java_multiple_files](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L364)
value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target input. The only accepted values are `false`
and `true`.

#### `java_package_prefix`

The `java_package_prefix` key is **optional**, and controls what the [java_package](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L348)
prefix value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target input. By default, the value is `com`.

#### `java_string_check_utf8`

The `java_string_check_utf8` key is **optional**, and controls what the [java_string_check_utf8](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L375)
value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target input. The only accepted values are `false`
and `true`.

#### `optimize_for`

The `optimize_for` key is **optional**, and controls what the [optimize_for](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L385)
value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target input. The only accepted values are `SPEED`, `CODE_SIZE` and `LITE_RUNTIME`.
If omitted, the default value, `SPEED`, is used.

#### `go_package_prefix`

The `go_package_prefix` key is **optional**, and controls what the [go_package](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51405b6b92c2070c8edea1b44c6770e00f7027be/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L392)
value is set to in all the files contained within the generation target input.

##### `default`

The `default` key is **required** if the `go_package_prefix` key is set. The `default` value is used as a prefix for the
`go_package` value set in each of the files. The `default` value **must** be a relative filepath that **must not** jump context
from the current directory, that is they must be subdirectories relative to the current working directory. As an example,
`../external` is invalid.

In the configuration example shown above, the `github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go` prefix is *joined* with the given Protobuf
file's relative path from the module root. In the `buf.build/acme/weather` module's case, the `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto`
file would have the following `go_package` set:

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
```

> If the Protobuf file's package declaration conforms to the `PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX` lint rule, the final two path elements are
> concatenated and included after the `;` element in the `go_package` result. The above example will generate a Go package with a package
> delcaration equal to `weatherv1`, which makes it easier to import Go definitions from a variety of generated packages that would otherwise
> collide (i.e. a lot of Protobuf packages will contain the `v1` suffix).

##### `except`

The `except` key is **optional**, and removes certain modules from the `go_package` file option override behavior. The `except` values **must**
be valid [module names](../bsr/overview.md#module).

There are situations where you will want to enable **Managed Mode** for the `go_package` option in *most* of your Protobuf files, but not necessarily
for *all* of your Protobuf files. This is particularly relevant for the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module, which points its `go_package` value to
an [external repository](https://github.com/googleapis/go-genproto). Popular libraries, such as [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) depend on these
`go_package` values, so it's important that **Managed Mode** does not overwrite them.

##### `override`

The `override` key is **optional**, and overrides the `go_package` file option value used for specific modules. The `override` keys **must** be valid
module names. Additionally, the corresponding `override` values **must** be a valid [Go import path](https://golang.org/ref/spec#ImportPath)
and **must not** jump context from the current directory. As an example, `../external` is invalid.

This setting is used for [workspace](../reference/workspaces.md) environments, where you have a module that imports from another module in the same workspace, and
you need to generate the Go code for each module in different directories. This is particularly relevant for repositories that decouple their private API
definitions from their public API definitions (as is the case for `buf`).

#### `override`

This is a list of per-file overrides for each modifier. In the example provided above, an override for `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` is set for the `java_package_prefix`
modifier to be `org` instead of `com`. This will set `org` as the package prefix for **only** the specific `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` file and **not** for the rest of the module.

## Default behavior

When `managed.enabled` is set to `true`, the following file options will be set *on the fly* for all of the files contained in the module:

* `csharp_namespace` is set to the package name with each package sub-name capitalized.
* `java_multiple_files` is set to `true`.
* `java_outer_classname` is set to the `PascalCase`-equivalent of the file's name, removing the "." for the `.proto` extension.
* `java_package` is set to the package name with `com.` prepended to it.
* `objc_class_prefix` is set to the uppercase first letter of each package sub-name, not including the package version, with the following rules:
  * If the resulting abbreviation is 2 characters, add "X".
  * If the resulting abbreviation is 1 character, add "XX".
  * If the resulting abbreviation is "GPB", change it to "GPX". "GPB" is reserved by Google for the Protocol Buffers implementation.
* `php_namespace` is set to the package name with each package sub-name capitalized, with "\\" substituted for ".".
* `php_metadata_namespace` is set to the same value as php_namespace, with `\\GPBMetadata` appended.
* `ruby_package` is set to the package name with each package sub-name capitalized, with "::" substituted for ".".

For example, enabling **Managed Mode** for the `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` file sets its file options to the following:

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option csharp_namespace = "Acme.Weather.V1";
option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_outer_classname = "WeatherProto";
option java_package = "com.acme.weather.v1";
option objc_class_prefix = "AWX";
option php_namespace = "Acme\\Weather\\V1";
option php_metadata_namespace = "Acme\\Weather\\V1\\GPBMetadata";
option ruby_package = "Acme::Weather::V1";
```

> Some options, such as `cc_enable_arenas` and `optimize_for`, are excluded from this list because **Managed Mode** agrees with the default
> values specified by [google/protobuf/descriptor.go](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/b650ea44b10133008baaea7488360c5b95c93c7b/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L385).
> If you disagree with the default values, you can override these option values, which is described in the [following section](#file-option-overrides).

## File option overrides

You might find that several of the options set by **Managed Mode** are not what you want. This is particularly relevant for options that
influence the content of the generated code, and are less focused on the generated package and/or file layout (e.g. `java_package`).
For this reason, **Managed Mode** lets users override the values of several options, including `cc_enable_arenas`, `java_multiple_files`,
`java_string_check_utf8`, and `optimize_for`.

You can configure each of these options under the `managed` key like so:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  cc_enable_arenas: false
  java_multiple_files: false
  java_string_check_utf8: false
  optimize_for: CODE_SIZE
plugins:
  - name: java
    out: gen/proto/java
```
