We'd love to stay in touch, here's a few ways to stay up to date:

- Star and/or watch [github.com/bufbuild/buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) for development
  and release updates.
- Join the [Buf Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bufbuild/shared_invite/zt-f5k547ki-VDs_iC4TblNCu7ubhRD17w)
  to stay in touch and discuss Buf.
- Join the [bufbuild-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bufbuild-announce) Google Group
  for general announcements. We'll aim not to spam this list, this will be used for releases,
  new features, and roadmap updates.
