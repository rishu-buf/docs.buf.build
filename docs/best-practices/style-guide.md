title: Style Guide
---

This is our Style Guide for Protobuf.

This document is purposefully concise, and is meant as a short reference for
developers to refer to when writing Protobuf schemas.

The requirements follow the [`DEFAULT`](../lint/rules.md#default) lint category. For details on each
rule and it's rationale, see that documentation. Within this Style Guide, we provide
links under (Why?) where relevant for each check.

These recommendations are not enforced by the [BSR](../bsr/overview.md), but are rather for reference.

This Style Guide is designed to provide consistency and maintainability across a
Protobuf schema of any size and any purpose, but without being so opinionated as
to restrict organizations from making the design decisions they need to make for
their individual APIs.


## Requirements

### Files and Packages

All files should have a package defined. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#package_defined)

All files of the same package should be in the same directory. All files should
be in a directory that matches their package name. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#why)

For example, if we have a [module](../bsr/overview.md#module) defined in the `proto` directory, we
expect the following `package` values:

```sh
.
└── proto
    ├── buf.yaml
    └── foo
        └── bar
            ├── bat
            │   └── v1
            │       └── bat.proto // package foo.bar.bat.v1
            └── baz
                └── v1
                    ├── baz.proto         // package foo.bar.baz.v1
                    └── baz_service.proto // package foo.bar.baz.v1
```

Packages should be `lower.snake_case`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#package_lower_snake_case)

The last component of a package should be a version. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#package_version_suffix)

Files should be named `lower_snake_case.proto` [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#file_lower_snake_case)

The following file options should have the same value, or all be unset, for
all files that have the same package: [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#package_same_)

- `csharp_namespace`
- `go_package`
- `java_multiple_files`
- `java_package`
- `php_namespace`
- `ruby_package`
- `swift_prefix`

For example, if we have file `foo_one.proto`:

```protobuf title="foo_one.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package foo.v1;

option go_package = "foov1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.foo.v1";
```

Another file `foo_two.proto` with package `foo.v1` must have these three options
set to the same value, and the other options unset:

```protobuf title="foo_two.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package foo.v1;

option go_package = "foov1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.foo.v1";
```

### Imports

No imports should be declared as `public` or `weak`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#import_no_weak)

### Enums

Enums should not have the `allow_alias` option set. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#enum_no_allow_alias)

Enum names should be `PascalCase`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

Enum value names should be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

Enum value names should be prefixed with the `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` of the enum name.
[(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#enum_value_prefix). For example, given the enum `FooBar`, all
enum value names should be prefixed with `FOO_BAR_`.

The zero value for all enums should be suffixed with `_UNSPECIFIED`.
[(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#enum_zero_value_suffix) The suffix is configurable
for `buf` linting. For example, given the enum `FooBar`, the zero value should be
`FOO_BAR_UNSPECIFIED = 0;`.

### Messages

Message names should be `PascalCase`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

Field names should be `lower_snake_case`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

Oneof names should be `lower_snake_case`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

### Services

Service names should be `PascalCase`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

Service names should be suffixed with `Service`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#service_suffix) The
suffix is configurable for `buf` linting.

RPC names should be `PascalCase`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#basic)

All RPC request and responses messages should be unique across your Protobuf schema. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#rpc_request_standard_name-rpc_response_standard_name-rpc_request_response_unique)


All RPC request and response messages should be named after the RPC, either by naming them
`MethodNameRequest`, `MethodNameResponse` or `ServiceNameMethodNameRequest`, `ServiceNameMethodNameResponse`. [(Why?)](../lint/rules.md#rpc_request_standard_name-rpc_response_standard_name-rpc_request_response_unique)

## Recommendations

While not strictly related to style, you should always set up breaking change detection for
your Protobuf schema. See the [breaking change detector documentation](../breaking/overview.md)
for more details on how to enforce this with `buf`.

Use `//` instead of `/* */` for comments.

Over-document, and use complete sentences for comments. Put documentation above
the type, instead of inline.

Avoid widely-used keywords for all types, especially packages. For example, if your
package name is `foo.internal.bar`, the `internal` component will block importing
the generated stubs in other packages for Golang.

Files should be ordered in the following manner (this matches [Google's current recommendations](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style#file-structure)):

- License header (if applicable)
- File overview
- Syntax
- Package
- Imports (sorted)
- File options
- Everything else

Used pluralized names for repeated fields.

Name fields after their type as much as possible. For example, for a field of message
type `FooBar`, name the field `foo_bar` unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise.

Avoid using nested enums and nested messages. You may end up wanting to use them outside
of their context message in the future, even if you do not think so at the moment.

While controversial, our recommendation is to avoid streaming RPCs. While they certainly
have specific use cases that make them extremely valuable, on the whole they generally cause
a lot of problems, push RPC framework logic up the stack, and usually prevent developing
more reliable architectures.
