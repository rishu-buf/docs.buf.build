title: 14 Push Workspace Modules
---

[Workspaces](../reference/workspaces.md) make it easy to work with and modify multiple local [modules](../bsr/overview.md#module)
at the same time. Once you're satisfied with your changes and are ready to push them to
the [BSR](../bsr/overview.md), there's a couple extra things you'll need to keep in mind to make sure
everything works as you expect.

## 14.1 Try to Push {#try-to-push}

The Go/gRPC client and server stubs were successfully generated, but if you try to push
the `petapis` module to the BSR, you'll notice the following:

```terminal
$ cd petapis
$ buf push
Failure: pet/v1/pet.proto:5:8:payment/v1alpha1/payment.proto: does not exist.
```

However, we can sucessfully build the module locally:

```
$ buf build
```

Recall that we can only build the module because of the [`buf.work.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-work-yaml.md)
located in the `start` directory. Without the `buf.work.yaml` file, the `petapis` module doesn't have access to the files
provided by the `paymentapis` module.

This is because **workspaces only apply to local operations**. When you are ready to push any updates
you've made in a local workspace, you'll need to push each module independently, starting with the
upstream modules first. Once the upstream module's changes are published, you can update the downstream
module to fetch the latest version, and continue to push each of your modules until all of your local
changes are published to the BSR.

For the `PetStoreService`, the order in which we need to publish updates is shown below:

```
googleapis -> paymentapis -> petapis
```

## 14.2 Push the `paymentapis` Module {#push-the-paymentapis-module}

We didn't make any changes to the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module, so we don't need to push a
new version of that module. However, we just introduced the `buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis` module,
so we first need to create the `buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis` repository so that we have somewhere
to push it:

```terminal
$ buf beta registry repository create buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis --visibility public
Full name                        Created
buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis  ...
```

Now that the repository exists, change into the `paymentapis` directory and push the module:

```terminal
$ cd ../paymentapis
$ buf push
2675d6a595ac4e0fb45cedc62edfc611
```

## 14.3 Push the `petapis` Module {#push-the-petapis-module}

The `buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis` repository now contains the same content we have locally, so we
can add it as a dependency to the local `petapis` module:

```terminal
$ cd ../petapis
```

```yaml title="petapis/buf.yaml" {4}
 version: v1
 deps:
   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
+  - buf.build/$BUF_USER/paymentapis
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
```

Update your dependencies with following:

```terminal
$ buf mod update
```

Your [`buf.lock`](../configuration/v1/buf-lock.md) should contain a reference to both `googleapis` and `paymentapis`:

```yaml title="buf.lock"
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: $BUF_USER
    repository: paymentapis
    branch: main
    commit: dac7c0d731d74ee78aea6f5f812e6997
    digest: b1-jrrTlZyx9gYfpWv9KoSkEJmzheEMQMvvaa4UtGOxzCo=
    create_time: ...
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: googleapis
    repository: googleapis
    branch: main
    commit: 1c473ad9220a49bca9320f4cc690eba5
    digest: b1-unlhrcI3tnJd0JEGuOb692LZ_tY_gCGq6mK1bgCn1Pg=
    create_time: ...
```

With this, we can successfully push the `petapis` module:

```terminal
$ buf push
dda6041ec265455d813f037c36c30349
```
