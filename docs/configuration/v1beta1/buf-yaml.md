> The `v1beta1` version described in this page is deprecated and should be replaced with [`v1`](../v1/buf-yaml.md).
> You can easily migrate your `v1beta1` configuration to `v1` by following the [migration guide](../v1beta1-migration-guide.md).

The `buf.yaml` file defines a [module](../../bsr/overview.md#module), and is placed at the root of the Protobuf source files
it defines. The placement of the `buf.yaml` configuration tells `buf` where to search for `.proto` files,
and how to handle imports.

This file contains [lint](../../lint/rules.md) and [breaking change detection](../../breaking/rules.md) rules, and if applicable, the name of your module and a list of dependencies.

## Default values

The following `buf.yaml` file demonstrates all default values being explicitly set, this file is the equivalent of no options being set in your `buf.yaml` at all.

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
name: ""
deps: []
build:
  roots:
    - .
  excludes: []
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
  enum_zero_value_suffix: _UNSPECIFIED
  rpc_allow_same_request_response: false
  rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_requests: false
  rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_responses: false
  service_suffix: Service
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
```

## Fields

### `version`

The `version` key is **required**, and defines the current configuration version. The only accepted
values are `v1beta1` and `v1`.

### `name`

The `name` is **optional**, and uniquely identifies your module. The `name` **must** be a valid [module name](../../bsr/overview.md#module)
and is directly associated with the repository that owns it.

### `deps`

The `deps` key is **optional**, and declares one or more modules that your module depends on. Each `deps`
entry **must** be a module reference, and, is directly associated with a repository, as well as a
[reference](../../bsr/overview.md#referencing-a-module), which is either a tag or commit. A complete example of
the different `deps` format is shown below:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
name: buf.build/acme/petapis
deps:
  - buf.build/acme/paymentapis                           # The latest commit.
  - buf.build/acme/pkg:47b927cbb41c4fdea1292bafadb8976f  # The '47b927cbb41c4fdea1292bafadb8976f' commit.
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis:v1beta1.1.0          # The 'v1beta1.1.0' tag.
```

> Depending on specific references is an advanced feature; you should depend on the latest commit whenever
> possible. In other words, your `deps` will not need to include the `:<reference>` suffix in most cases.
> Please refer to `buf`'s [best practices](../../best-practices/module-development.md) to learn more!

### `build`

The `build` key is **optional**, and is used to include and exclude specific Protobuf source files in the
module defined by the `buf.yaml`. The following is an example of all configuration options for
`build`:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
build:
  roots:
    - proto
    - vendor/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis
  excludes:
    - proto/foo/bar
```

#### `excludes`

This is a list of the directories to ignore from `.proto` file discovery. Any directories added
to this list will be completely skipped and not included in the module. **We do not recommend
using this option in general**, however in some situations it is unavoidable.

#### `roots`

> `roots` are no longer recommended and have been removed in `v1` in favor of [workspaces](../../reference/workspaces.md). If you
> have any `roots` configured, please refer to the [migration guide](../v1beta1-migration-guide.md).

This is a list of the directories that contain your `.proto` files. The directory paths must be relative
to the root of your `buf.yaml`, and cannot point to a location outside of your `buf.yaml`. They also represent
the root of your import paths within your `.proto` files.

For those familiar with `protoc`, `roots` corresponds to your `--proto_paths`, aliased as `-I` with `protoc` -
that is, these are the directories that the compiler uses to search for imports.

As an example, suppose your module defines two files, `proto/foo/bar/bar.proto` and `proto/foo/baz/baz.proto`.
If you want these files to refer to each other without the common `proto` root, you would configure the following.

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
build:
  roots:
    - proto
```

If `baz.proto` wants to import `bar.proto`, it does so relative to `proto/`:

```protobuf title="proto/foo/baz/baz.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package foo.baz;

import "foo/bar/bar.proto";
```

#### Root requirements

> These requirements are no longer relevant in `v1` because `roots` have been removed. These guidelines remain for users
> that are still using `v1beta1`. For more information, please refer to the [migration guide](../v1beta1-migration-guide.md).

There are two additional requirements that `buf` imposes on your `.proto` file structure for compilation to succeed that
are not enforced by `protoc`, both of which are very important for successful modern Protobuf development across a number
of languages.

**1. Roots must not overlap, that is one root can not be a sub-directory of another root.**

For example, the following is not a valid configuration:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
# THIS IS INVALID AND WILL RESULT IN A PRE-COMPILATION ERROR
build:
  roots:
    - foo
    - foo/bar
```

This is important to make sure that across all your `.proto` files, imports are consistent In the above example, for a given
file `foo/bar/bar.proto`, it would be valid to import this file as either `bar/bar.proto` or `bar.proto`. Having inconsistent
imports leads to a number of major issues across the Protobuf plugin ecosystem.

**2. All `.proto` file paths must be unique relative to the roots.**

For example, consider the following configuration:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
build:
  roots:
    - foo
    - bar
```

*Given the above configuration, it is invalid to have the following two files:*

- `foo/baz/baz.proto`
- `bar/baz/baz.proto`

This results in two files having the path `baz/baz.proto`. Given the following third file `bar/baz/bat.proto`:

```protobuf
// THIS IS DEMONSTRATING SOMETHING BAD
syntax = "proto3";

package bar.baz;

import "baz/baz.proto";
```

Which file is being imported? Is it `foo/baz/baz.proto`? `bar/baz/baz.proto`? The answer depends on the order of the `-I`
flags given to `protoc`. If the authors are being honest, we can't remember if it's the first `-I` or second `-I` that wins -
we have outlawed this in our own builds for a long time.

While the above example is relatively contrived, the common error that comes up is when you have vendored `.proto` files.
For example, [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/tree/master/third_party/googleapis/google) has it's
own copy of the [google.api](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/api) definitions it needs. While these
are usually in sync, the `google.api` schema can change. If we allowed the following:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1beta1
# THIS IS INVALID AND WILL RESULT IN A PRE-COMPILATION ERROR
build:
  roots:
    - proto
    - vendor/github.com/googleapis/googleapis
    - vendor/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis
```

Which copy of `google/api/*.proto` wins? The answer is no one wins, so this is not allowed.

### `lint`

The `lint` key is **optional**, and specifies the `lint` rules enforced on the files contained within the
module. The `lint` configuration shape is unchanged between `v1beta1` and `v1`, so please refer
to the [lint configuration](../../lint/configuration.md) for more information.

### `breaking`

The `breaking` key is **optional**, and specifies the breaking change detection rules enforced on the files
contained within the module. The `breaking` configuration shape is unchanged between `v1beta1` and
`v1`, so please refer to the [breaking configuration](../../breaking/configuration.md) for more information.
