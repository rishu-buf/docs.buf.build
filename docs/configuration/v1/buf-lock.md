If your [`buf.yaml`](buf-yaml.md) declares any `deps`, it will be accompanied by a `buf.lock` file that contains your
[module](../../bsr/overview.md#module)'s dependency manifest. This manifest represents a single, reproducible build of your module.

You can create or update a `buf.lock` file for your module by running the `buf mod update` command. For
example, suppose that we have the following directory layout and `buf.lock` content for the `buf.build/acme/petapis`
module:

```sh
.
├── acme
│   └── pet
│       └── v1
│           └── pet.proto
├── buf.lock
└── buf.yaml
```

```yaml title="buf.lock"
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: acme
    repository: paymentapis
    branch: main
    commit: 42abe5cfeb904508839378050d95ab13
    digest: b1-adftuIW3X3VYL65FfLiqkmW_DIDUuqRbyuxOSmscA4B=
    create_time: 2021-06-02T10:28:18.283761Z
```

### `deps`

Each entry in the `buf.lock` `deps` key is a module pin, which uniquely represents a specific
snapshot of the given module (`buf.build/acme/paymentapis:5173e5cfeb904508839378050d95e1de` in this
case). With this, the local snapshot of the `buf.build/acme/petapis` module and all of its dependencies
are uniquely represented and reproducible.

### Push and update modules

You can then publish and share this particular snapshot with your consumers and/or collaborators by
pushing it to the [BSR](../../bsr/overview.md) with the following command:

```sh
$ buf push
```

With this, modules that depend on `buf.build/acme/petapis` will be able to run `buf mod update` and notice
a new module pin in their `buf.lock`! For example, we can update the content found in this module's
`buf.lock` by running the following:

```title="buf.lock"
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: acme
    repository: paymentapis
    branch: main
    commit: 5173e5cfeb904508839378050d95e1de
    digest: b1-tteutIW3X3VYL65FfLiqkmW_DIDUuqRbyuxOSmscB5Q=
    create_time: 2021-06-03T17:53:54.361543Z
```
