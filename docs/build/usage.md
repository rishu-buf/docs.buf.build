> We highly recommend completing [the tour](../tour/configure-and-build.md) to get an overview of `buf build`.

All `buf` operations rely on building, or compiling, Protobuf files. The [linter](../lint/overview.md),
[breaking change detector](../breaking/overview.md), [generator](../generate/usage.md),
and the [BSR](../bsr/overview.md) are features that rely on compilation results. In its simplest form,
the `buf build` command is used to verify that an [input](../reference/inputs.md) compiles.

## Configuration

`buf` is configured with the [`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) configuration file, which is placed
at the root of the Protobuf source files it defines. The placement of the `buf.yaml` configuration tells `buf`
where to search for `.proto` files, and how to handle imports. As opposed to `protoc`, where all `.proto` files
are manually specified on the command-line, `buf` operates by recursively discovering all `.proto` files under
configuration and building them.

The following is an example of all configuration options for `build`:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
build:
  excludes:
    - foo/bar
```

The `build` section only has one option:

### `excludes`

The `excludes` key is **optional**, and lists directories to ignore from `.proto` file discovery. Any directories
added to this list will be completely skipped and excluded in the result. **We do not recommend using this
option in general**, however in some situations it is unavoidable.

For more information on the `buf.yaml` configuration, please refer to the [reference](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md).

### Default values

In `buf`'s default input mode, it assumes there is a `buf.yaml` in your current directory, or uses
the default values in lieu of a `buf.yaml` file. We recommend always having a `buf.yaml` file at the
root of your `.proto` files hierarchy, as this is how `.proto` import paths are resolved.

## Define a Module

To get started, create a [module](../bsr/overview.md#module) by adding a `buf.yaml` file to the root of the directory
that contains your Protobuf definitions. You can create the default `buf.yaml` file with the following command:

```sh
$ buf config init
```

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
```

## Modules and Workspaces

For those of you that have used `protoc`, the placement of the `buf.yaml` is analogous to a `protoc`
include (`-I`) path. **With `buf`, there is no `-I` flag** - each `protoc` `-I` path maps to a directory
that contains a `buf.yaml` (called a module in Buf parlance), and multiple modules are stitched
together with a [`buf.work.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-work-yaml.md), which defines a [workspace](../reference/workspaces.md).

To illustrate how all these pieces fit together here's a quick example using `protoc` and its equivalent
in `buf`:

```sh
$ protoc \
    -I proto \
    -I vendor/protoc-gen-validate \
    -o /dev/null \
    $(find proto -name '*.proto')
```

A `buf.yaml` would be placed in the `proto` and `vendor/protoc-gen-validate` directories, and you would define
a `buf.work.yaml` that contains the following:

```sh {8,11}
.
├── buf.work.yaml
├── proto
│   ├── acme
│   │   └── weather
│   │       └── v1
│   │           └── weather.proto
│   └── buf.yaml
└── vendor
    └── protoc-gen-validate
        ├── buf.yaml
        └── validate
            └── validate.proto
```

```yaml title="buf.work.yaml"
version: v1
directories:
  - proto
  - vendor/protoc-gen-validate
```

Like the `-I` flag for `protoc`, workspaces make it possible to import definitions across modules, such as introducing
a new `message` in one module, and importing it from another. Similarly, any command that is run on an input that contains
a `buf.work.yaml` will act upon *all* of the modules defined in the `buf.work.yaml`.

## Workspace requirements

There are two additional requirements that `buf` imposes on your `.proto` file structure
for compilation to succeed that are not enforced by `protoc`, both of which are very
important for successful modern Protobuf development across a number of languages

**1. Workspace modules must not overlap, that is one workspace module can not be a sub-directory of another workspace module.**

For example, the following is not a valid configuration:

```yaml title="buf.work.yaml"
version: v1
# THIS IS INVALID AND WILL RESULT IN A PRE-COMPILATION ERROR
directories:
  - foo
  - foo/bar
```

This is important to make sure that across all your `.proto` files, imports are consistent.
In the above example, for a given file `foo/bar/bar.proto`, it would be valid to import
this file as either `bar/bar.proto` or `bar.proto`. Having inconsistent imports leads
to a number of major issues across the Protobuf plugin ecosystem.

**2. All `.proto` file paths must be unique relative to each workspace module.**

For example, consider the following configuration:

```yaml title="buf.work.yaml"
version: v1
directories:
  - foo
  - bar
```

*Given the above configuration, it is invalid to have the following two files:*

  - `foo/baz/baz.proto`
  - `bar/baz/baz.proto`

This results in two files having the path `baz/baz.proto`. Given the following third file
`bar/baz/bat.proto`:

```protobuf
// THIS IS DEMONSTRATING SOMETHING BAD
syntax = "proto3";

package bar.baz;

import "baz/baz.proto";
```

Which file is being imported? Is it `foo/baz/baz.proto`? `bar/baz/baz.proto`? The answer depends
on the order of the `-I` flags given to `protoc`, or (if `buf` didn't error in this scenario
pre-compilation, which `buf` does) the order of the imports given to the internal compiler. If
the authors are being honest, we can't remember if it's the first `-I` or second `-I` that wins -
we have outlawed this in our own builds for a long time.

While the above example is relatively contrived, the common error that comes up is when you
have vendored `.proto` files. For example, [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/tree/master/third_party/googleapis/google)
has it's own copy of the [google.api](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/api) definitions it needs.
While these are usually in sync, the `google.api` schema can change. If we allowed the following:

```yaml
version: v1
# THIS IS INVALID AND WILL RESULT IN A PRE-COMPILATION ERROR
directories:
  - proto
  - vendor/github.com/googleapis/googleapis
  - vendor/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis
```

Which copy of `google/api/*.proto` wins? The answer is no one wins, so this is not allowed.

## Run build

You can run `buf build` on your module by specifying the filepath to the directory containing the
`buf.yaml`. In the above example, you can target the module defined in the current directory like so:

```sh
$ buf build
```

The `buf build` command will:

  - Discover all Protobuf files per your `buf.yaml` configuration.
  - Copy the Protobuf files into memory.
  - Compile all Protobuf files.
  - Output the compiled result to a configurable location (defaults to `/dev/null`)

If there are errors, they will be printed out in a `file:line:column:message` format by default.
For example:

```sh
$ buf build
acme/pet/v1/pet.proto:5:8:acme/payment/v1alpha1/payment.proto: does not exist
```

Build output can also be printed as JSON:

```sh
$ buf build --error-format=json
{"path":"acme/pet/v1/pet.proto","start_line":5,"start_column":8,"end_line":5,"end_column":8,"type":"COMPILE","message":"acme/payment/v1alpha1/payment.proto: does not exist"}
```

## Output format

By default, `buf build` will output the its result to `/dev/null`. In this case, it's common to use
`buf build` as a validation step, analogous to checking if the input compiles.

However, `buf build` also supports outputting [FileDescriptorSets](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto)
and [Images](../reference/images.md), which is Buf's custom extension of the FileDescriptorSet. Better yet, these outputs
can be formatted in a variety of ways.

Per the [input documentation](../reference/inputs.md), `buf build` can deduce the output format by the file extension. For example,

```sh
$ buf build -o image.bin
$ buf build -o image.bin.gz
$ buf build -o image.bin.zst
$ buf build -o image.json
$ buf build -o image.json.gz
$ buf build -o image.json.zst
```

The special value `-` is used to denote stdout, and you can manually set the format. For example:

```sh
$ buf build -o -#format=json
```

When combined with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq), `buf build` also allows for introspection. For example,
to see a list of all packages, you can run the following command:

```
$ buf build -o -#format=json | jq '.file[] | .package' | sort | uniq | head
"google.actions.type"
"google.ads.admob.v1"
"google.ads.googleads.v1.common"
"google.ads.googleads.v1.enums"
"google.ads.googleads.v1.errors"
"google.ads.googleads.v1.resources"
"google.ads.googleads.v1.services"
"google.ads.googleads.v2.common"
"google.ads.googleads.v2.enums"
"google.ads.googleads.v2.errors"
```

Images always include the `ImageExtension` field. However, if you want a pure FileDescriptorSet without
this field set, to mimic `protoc` entirely, you can use the `--as-file-descriptor-set` flag like so:

```sh
$ buf build -o image.bin --as-file-descriptor-set
```

The `ImageExtension` field will not affect Protobuf plugins or any other operations, they will merely see this as an unknown
field. However, we provide the option in case you want it.

## Limit to specific files

By default, `buf` builds all files under the `buf.yaml` configuration file. You can instead manually specify the
file or directory paths to build. This is an advanced feature intended to be used for editor or Bazel integration - it
is better to let `buf` discover all files under management and handle this for you in general.

The compiled result will be limited to the given files if the `--path` flag is specified like so:

```sh
$ buf build --path path/to/foo.proto --path path/to/bar.proto
```

## Docker

Buf ships a Docker image [bufbuild/buf](https://hub.docker.com/r/bufbuild/buf) that allows
you to use `buf` as part of your Docker workflow. For example:

```sh
$ docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/workspace" \
  --workdir /workspace \
  bufbuild/buf build
```
