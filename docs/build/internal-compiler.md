Protobuf is the most stable and widely adopted interface description language available
today - it's why Buf is concentrating it's initial efforts on Protobuf. However, Protobuf
has never had an officially-published Protobuf grammar - [there are proto2 and proto3
specs published](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec),
but neither actually cover all edge cases, of which there are many (especially around options).

In effect, the official Protobuf "grammar" is the `protoc` implementation - this has been the
only codified representation of what Protobuf is, and the only way to properly parse Protobuf
messages and produce [FileDescriptorSets](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto)
suitable for stub generation.

Additionally, there are many situations outside of stub generation that rely on a proper
Protobuf parsing, such as [linting](../lint/overview.md) and [breaking change detection](../breaking/overview.md).
All existing Protobuf tooling has gone one of two routes:

  1. Use a third-party Protobuf parser instead of `protoc` that produces non-FileDescriptorSet results.
     There are many third-party Protobuf parsers in existence, however no parser has been able to
     reliably cover all edge cases of the grammar, inevitably there are breakdowns that either result
     in parse errors, or an invalid representation of Protobuf sources. The edge cases in the Protobuf
     grammar are so numerous, that some of the most popular third-party parsers actually get around the
     problem by happily parsing invalid Protobuf, resulting in being unable to make a decision from these
     parsers as to whether or not a file is valid.

  2. Shell out to (or build against) `protoc`. This results in both accurate parsing, and FileDescriptorSet
     production, however this method presents a number of issues. First, actually managing external `protoc`
     installs becomes problematic - it makes any tooling reliant on either managing `protoc` installation
     itself, or relying on `protoc` being deterministically installed. Second, parsing `protoc`'s output is
     difficult, as there is no structured output format, both warnings and errors are printed to stderr, and
     the warning and error output changes between minor releases. To accurately parse `protoc`, tooling needs
     to handle every release of `protoc` as it comes out, which makes any such tooling unmaintainable.
     Additionally, `protoc` has different behavior depending on the location of the [Well-Known Types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf).

We find neither of these solutions to be tenable in the long-term for a tool that aims to manage your
Protobuf schema. Therefore, we've taken a different route.

The [internal compiler](https://godoc.org/github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/protoparse) quite literally replaces
`protoc` outside of the builtin plugins (`--java_out`, `--cpp_out`, etc.). The resulting FileDescriptorSets
are tested for equivalence to `protoc`, including both `proto2` and `proto3` definitions, imports,
[FileDescriptorProto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto) ordering,
[SourceCodeInfo](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto), and custom options.

The result FileDescriptorSets are almost byte-equivalent to `protoc`, in fact - under most scenarios without
SourceCodeInfo, you can actually compare the byte representation of a serialized FileDescriptorSet
produced by `buf` and by `protoc`, and they will be equal. There are two known exceptions that make this not always
the case:

  1. `buf` produces additional intermediate SourceCodeInfo, and retains more
     detached comments, than `protoc`. This is strictly more information for consumers
     of the resulting FileDescriptorSets.

  2. `buf` represents custom/unknown options slightly differently on the wire, although
     when deserialized, the result is equivalent for consumers of FileDescriptorSets.
     There is an effort to work around this, so that FileDescriptorSets can be compared
     for testing, however it is not high priority as it has zero effect on any actual usage.

Besides removing the need to manually manage `protoc` and the [Well-Known Types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf)
(which `buf` handles in all cases), `buf`'s compiler considerably *faster* than `protoc` in most scenarios. `buf` parses your `.proto`
files across all available cores, and re-orders the result to match `protoc`'s ordering as a post-processing task.
As an example, `buf` can compile all 2,311 `.proto` files in [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis)
in about 0.8s, on a four-core machine, as opposed to about 4.3s for `protoc` on the same machine.

**We know this is all a series of big claims**. There have been many claims in the Protobuf community about producing
non-`protoc`-based parsing, so this is one of the reasons that we enable `protoc` output to be `buf` input. If you
don't trust us, then use `protoc` as your compiler instead, no problem.

It's also one of the reasons we've exposed [`buf build`](../build/usage.md) as we have - you can produce
FileDescriptorSets yourself and pass them to your Protobuf plugins to verify that the resulting stubs are
equivalent. There is one known exception with docs generated based on `json_name`, see [this
issue](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/5587) to track this being updated within `protoc`.

Given the following call:

```sh
# Adjust -I as necessary; this example includes the current directory.
$ rm -rf java
$ mkdir java
$ protoc -I . --java_out=java $(find . -name '*.proto')
```

You can instead use `buf`'s compiler to generate your stubs by using the `--descriptor_set_in` flag of `protoc`:

```sh
# We need to do "buf build | buf ls-files -" instead of "buf ls-files"
# to make sure that the filenames are root
$ rm -rf java
$ mkdir java
$ buf build -o - | protoc --descriptor_set_in=/dev/stdin --java_out=java $(buf ls-files)
```

This results in protoc's internal parser not being used at all, so you can verify our claims further. If you do find
an issue, please [contact us](../contact.md).

Having this new compiler is a key component of Buf's future. Right now, it enables reliable [linting](../lint/overview.md),
[breaking change detection](../breaking/overview.md), [generation](../generate/usage.md), and the [BSR](../bsr/overview.md).
In the future, it enables a lot of other real-time possibilities for us.
